# All Hail the Wobbly Sphere

That's right. I just wanted to make a weird sphere in react-three-fiber.
Featuring the distort material from r3f-drei. 

P.S. try clicking on it.

# How To

Clone this repository.

Create a `.env` file and define 
- RANDOM_CAT_BASE_URL = cataas.com
- RANDOM_CAT_URL=https://cataas.com/cat

You could use a totally different source for your profile pic but hey cats are good
(this is entirely unrelated to the wobbly sphere because this started out as something entirely different lol)

Run `yarn` and once all dependencies are installed `yarn dev` to see what it's all about.
